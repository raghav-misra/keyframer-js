# CSS Animations + Javascript = `KeyframerJS`
---
- **Extremely lightweight.**
- Modifying CSS has always been a pain with JavaScript, but not anymore!
    - Create custom transitions with the same old CSS syntax you're used to.
    - Add callback functions that are called when your transition/animation completes.
    - Create *frames*, or JS-only Keyframer classes to change styles @ runtime. (Coming Soon)
    - Ever wanted to create an animation `onclick`? How about `onkeypress`? You can't do **that** with Vanilla CSS, can you?
- JS Animations are on the rise, but they are time consuming to make. Let KeyframerJS help you! (Coming Soon)
