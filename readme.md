# CSS + Javascript = [`KeyframerJS`](https://raghav-misra.github.io/keyframer-js)

## What does it do?
KeyframerJS simplifies CSS in JavaScript, so you don't have to.

## Why should I use it?
* **Extremely lightweight.**
* Modifying CSS with JavaScript has often been somewhat of a pain, but not anymore!
  - Create custom transitions with the same old CSS syntax you're used to.
  - Add callback functions that are called when your transition/animation completes.
  - Create `frames`, or JS-only Keyframer classes to easily change styles @ runtime.
  - Ever wanted to create an animation `onclick`? How about `onkeypress`? You can't do _that_ with Vanilla CSS, can you?
  - Keyframer supports **every** DOM event there is, including special support for key-related events.
* JS Animations are on the rise, but they are time consuming to make. Let KeyframerJS help you! **(Coming Soon)*

## Roadmap/To-Do:
* Add support for JS Animations.
* Finish documentation.
* Finish example.
