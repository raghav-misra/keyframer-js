# CSS + Javascript = [`KeyframerJS`](https://raghav-misra.github.io/keyframer-js)
- **Extremely lightweight.**
- Modifying CSS has always been a pain with JavaScript, but not anymore!
    - Create custom transitions with the same old CSS syntax you're used to.
    - Add callback functions that are called when your transition/animation completes.
    - Create `frames`, or JS-only Keyframer classes to easily change styles @ runtime.
    - Ever wanted to create an animation `onclick`? How about `onkeypress`? You can't do *that* with Vanilla CSS, can you?
    - Keyframer supports **every** DOM event there is, including special support for key-related events.
- JS Animations are on the rise, but they are time consuming to make. Let KeyframerJS help you! **(Coming Soon)**
